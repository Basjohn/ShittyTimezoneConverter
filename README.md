# Lasting Truamas
- 7 Hours getting poop icon to properly display
- 15 minutes to map a database of timezones and compare them with offsets and the system locale in a weighted system.

## How to Run

Win: Extract the exe version and run it. It should create all needed folders and files.

Nix/MacOS: Run the scripts because Pyinstall is apparently royalty and does not date outside it's family line.
