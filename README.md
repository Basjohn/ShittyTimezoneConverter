# Shitty Timezone Converter

A simple, DPI-aware, cross-platform timezone converter with a countdown timer and overlay functionality.

## Features
- Convert between all major timezones
- Handles daylight savings automatically
- Countdown timer to converted time
- Movable overlay with clickthrough, double click toggle and escape to centre/reset.
- Annoying sound feature
- Despair

## How to Run

Win: Extract DIR version and run the exe.
Or just run the EXE from the SOLO version. 
DIR mode is more compatible, SOLO is cleaner.
(Actually it's just the poop icon works better in dir mode)

Nix/MacOS: Run the scripts because Pyinstall is a fussy bitch.
